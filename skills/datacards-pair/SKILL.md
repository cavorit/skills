## DataCards

DataCards is a platform that orchestrates multiple marimo notebooks into a
graph of notebooks. A project is a workspace of notebooks served by one marimo
server behind the DataCards server. Notebooks exchange data through the data
catalog: `dc.data.publish("namespace.key", value)` in one notebook,
`dc.data.consume("namespace.key")`.
Every publish/consume pair is an edge of the project's process graph, which
the DataCards canvas draws as notebook nodes and variable nodes.

Notebooks can place cell outputs as *cards*: each cell appears as a card in
the notebook's Exposé view, and cards can be placed on *decks*, grid-based
visual dashboards (`columns` x `rows` units) that sit next to the graph on the
canvas. A deck card shows the live output of its cell, so a deck composes a
dashboard from cells of several notebooks. Decks, cards and the card-store
templates are owned by the DataCards server, not by any notebook file.

In DataCards notebooks `import datacards as dc` is the convention. The
`datacards` package re-exports the marimo API, so `dc.ui`, `dc.md` and
`dc.data` are marimo's; `import marimo as mo` works the same way.

### Connecting to a DataCards project

The primary use case is a project running in the DataCards cloud. Its URL has
the form `https://<host>/<team>/<project>/`; the project's "Pair with agent"
dialog shows that URL together with a project token (`dc_sk_proj_...`). Pass
the URL as `--url` and the token via `MARIMO_TOKEN` (preferred) or `--token`.
All notebooks of a project are sessions on that one URL, so pass `--file` with the
notebook's path when more than one notebook is open (the script lists the
available sessions when the value does not match):

```bash
MARIMO_TOKEN=dc_sk_proj_... bash /absolute/path/to/datacards-pair/scripts/execute-code.sh \
  --url https://<host>/<team>/<project>/ --file analysis.py \
  -c "import marimo._code_mode as cm; help(cm)"
```

Everything below about marimo (the kernel, the scratchpad, `cm`, the graph
contract) applies unchanged to each notebook of the project.

### DataCards functions in code mode

Besides the marimo cell API, `cm` exposes the DataCards actions a human has in
the frontend. Usage and rules are in
[DataCards Decks, Cards and Screenshots](#datacards-decks-cards-and-screenshots)
below:

- **Card title and size** - `create_cell(...)` and `edit_cell(...)` take
  `title=` and `size=(width, height)` in grid units (`1..24` x `1..12`). The
  size is the card's size in Exposé and its default size when added on a deck.
- **Decks** - `list_decks()` and `get_deck(deck_id)` return the decks of the
  project with their cards (`Deck`, `DeckCard`).
- **Cards on decks** - `add_card_to_deck(deck_id, cell, position=, size=)`,
  `edit_card_on_deck(deck_id, card, position=, size=)` and
  `remove_card_from_deck(deck_id, card)` place, move or resize, and remove a
  cell of this notebook on a deck.
- **Templates** - `list_templates()`, `add_template_to_deck(deck_id,
  template_id, ...)` and `assign_template_to_notebook(deck_id, card,
  notebook_file=...)` or `new_notebook=...`: card-store templates are
  ready-made cards (a slider, a chart, ...) placed on a deck and then assigned
  to a notebook, which inserts and runs the template's cells there.
- **Screenshots** - `screenshot(cell)`, `screenshot_deck(deck_id)` and
  `screenshot_graph()` capture a cell's output, a deck as on its own page, and
  the process graph on the canvas as PNG; `close_screenshot_session()` closes
  the headless browser.

These methods are `async`, apply immediately on the DataCards server (they are
not queued like cell edits) and work inside or outside `cm.get_context()`.
They need the request context of a code-mode execution, which is what
`execute-code.sh` provides; they raise `DeckError` when called elsewhere.

Use screenshot_deck(deck_id) when composing a dashboard ui from outputs. 
Use screenshot_graph() to visually inspect the orchestration of notebooks and see which notebook publishes or consumes which variable.

## marimo Notebooks

marimo is a reactive Python runtime for building reproducible Python programs
(marimo notebooks). Cells are connected by the variables they define and
reference. Running a cell re-executes dependents in dataflow order. The active
runtime holds the kernel namespace, cell state, and dataflow graph. The
notebook (`.py` file) is the artifact the kernel writes from that state while a
session is running.

A user interacts with the same runtime via a notebook UI with cells, outputs,
and widgets.

**WARNING. The active runtime is the source of truth.** During a session, you
SHOULD NOT modify the associated `.py` file directly. File edits WILL NOT reach
the active kernel or user, and the kernel may overwrite them on save. Use
`marimo._code_mode` (`cm`) for notebook changes. Reading disk is fine, but
prefer `ctx.cells[...].code` for current cell code.

The harness reports the absolute path to this `SKILL.md`. Resolve bundled
`scripts/...` and `reference/...` paths from its parent directory, even when
the current working directory is a notebook workspace. In command examples,
replace `/absolute/path/to/datacards-pair` with that directory.

## Required first kernel command

Start every code-mode session with this dedicated command:

```bash
bash /absolute/path/to/datacards-pair/scripts/execute-code.sh \
  --url http://localhost:2718 \
  -c "import marimo._code_mode as cm; help(cm)"
```

Follow this order for each kernel, including read-only tasks:

1. Run the inspection command once.
2. Wait for successful `help(cm)` output.
3. Then use `cm.get_context()` or another `cm` API in a later call.

Do not run task-specific `cm` code before the inspection command succeeds.

## Connect to a Notebook

Use the bundled `execute-code.sh` from the reported skill directory or MCP
(`execute_code(...)`) to run Python in a live marimo kernel.

`execute-code.sh` always takes `--url`. If the user provides a notebook URL,
run the required inspection against it directly:

```bash
bash /absolute/path/to/datacards-pair/scripts/execute-code.sh \
  --url http://localhost:2718 \
  -c "import marimo._code_mode as cm; help(cm)"
```

After that command succeeds, pass task code with `-c CODE`, `-` for stdin, or
a file path:

```bash
bash /absolute/path/to/datacards-pair/scripts/execute-code.sh \
  --url http://localhost:2718 - <<'PY'
import marimo._code_mode as cm

async with cm.get_context() as ctx:
    cid = ctx.create_cell("x = df.head()")
    ctx.run_cell(cid)
PY
```

If the user gives no URL, find or start a notebook. Look for a running server
with `bash /absolute/path/to/datacards-pair/scripts/discover-servers.sh`, MCP
`list_sessions()`, or local process context, and pass the `url` it reports to
`--url`. With one notebook open, the script targets it automatically; with
several, pass `--file` with the notebook's file key.

If no server is running and the user wants a notebook, start marimo with
`--no-token` (and without `--headless`) so it auto-registers for discovery. The
notebook UI must be open for `execute-code` to target it. The right invocation
depends on context (project tooling, global install, sandbox mode). If the
notebook file contains a PEP 723 `#
/// script` header, it MUST be opened with `--sandbox` — otherwise marimo
ignores the inline dependencies. See
[finding-marimo.md](reference/finding-marimo.md) for the full decision tree and
[execution-context.md](reference/execution-context.md) for selector resolution,
scripts, MCP, and shell quoting.

## Scratchpad Scope

`execute-code` evaluates Python in marimo's scratchpad: a temporary namespace
with a shallow copy of the kernel globals. Notebook variables are available by
name, but new top-level bindings and rebindings are discarded after each call.
In-place mutations to notebook-owned objects can persist because those names
still reference live objects.

Each call reports stdout and stderr from the scratchpad, plus console output
from notebook cells it causes to run, including reactive descendants.

### Ordinary Python

Use ordinary Python in the scratchpad to inspect variables, sample data, test
transformations, probe APIs, check imports, and read widget state.

```python
print(df.head())

x = 10
print(x)
```

Here `df` comes from notebook globals, while `x` is a scratchpad-local binding.
`x` exists for this call only and WILL NOT be added to notebook globals.

### Persist with `cm`

Top-level scratchpad assignments and rebindings are temporary. To persist work,
including new variables, you MUST submit changes through `marimo._code_mode`
(`cm`).

`marimo._code_mode` is a PRIVATE, UNSTABLE agent API (note the leading
underscore). It exists for tools like this skill to drive a live kernel from
the scratchpad. DO NOT import it from notebook cells, library code, or
anything a user would run — methods can change or disappear across marimo
versions and kernels. Treat every `import marimo._code_mode as cm` as
scratchpad-only.

Open a code-mode context to queue notebook changes.

```python
import marimo._code_mode as cm

async with cm.get_context() as ctx:
    cid = ctx.create_cell("x = df.head()")
    ctx.run_cell(cid)
```

The scratchpad supports top-level async code. Use `async with` directly;
wrapping it in `asyncio.run(...)` is unnecessary and can conflict with the
kernel's event loop.

After this block exits and the new cell runs, `x` is notebook state. Later
scratchpad calls can read `x` by name. Code later in the same scratchpad call
should read `ctx.globals["x"]`, because the scratchpad namespace was copied
before the cell ran.

Inside the context, queued mutation methods are synchronous. Call them
directly; do not `await` them. Each call queues an operation for marimo to
apply when the context exits normally. If the block raises, the queue is
discarded.

On clean exit, marimo applies packages, validates and applies structural cell
changes, runs queued cells, then may run dependents. Validation is only
structural since queued cell runs can still error. `create_cell` and
`edit_cell` change notebook structure only. Use `run_cell` to execute. 

`create_cell` currently defaults to `hide_code=True`, which collapses the code
editor in the UI. Pass `hide_code=False` if the user wants created cells to
be visible without manually expanding them.


## Marimo Rules

marimo imposes a small contract on notebook code so it can keep the notebook as
a directed acyclic graph (DAG):

- **No cycles** - cells cannot depend on each other in a cycle.
- **No public redefinitions across cells** - each name has one owning cell.
- **No wildcard imports** - `import *` prevents static analysis of definitions.

These rules keep the kernel, UI, and saved artifact consistent.

When `cm` submits a cell body, marimo parses its top-level definitions and
references. A top-level name enters the graph unless it is private with a
leading underscore.

```python
# Public definitions: values, total, i, value, mean
values = np.array([1, 2, 3])
total = 0
for i, value in enumerate(values):
    total += value
mean = total / len(values)
mean
```

```python
# Public definition: mean
_values = np.array([1, 2, 3])
_total = 0
for _i, _value in enumerate(_values):
    _total += _value
mean = _total / len(_values)
mean
```

Use private names for intermediates that no other cell should read. Public
names define the notebook-level dataflow. If a `cm` edit violates the contract,
marimo rejects the structural change and returns the validation error.

## The Notebook's Shape

A notebook is an ordered collection of cells. `ctx.cells` is the document view
and `ctx.graph` is the dataflow view.

```python
for cell in ctx.cells:
    cell  # .id, .code, .name, .config, .status, .errors

ctx.cells["setup"]         # by name
ctx.cells[0]               # by position
list(ctx.cells.keys())     # all IDs, in notebook order
```

Cell IDs are opaque strings which can be queried from the notebook or captured
from `cm` return values:

```python
cid = ctx.create_cell("df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')")
print(cid)   # e.g. 'Hbol'
```

Alternatively, cells can be assigned and referenced by `name`. The graph can be
used to understand its role in the dataflow.

```python
for cid, impl in ctx.graph.cells.items():
    impl  # .defs, .refs   (sets of public names)

ctx.graph.descendants(cid)   # cells that re-run when this one changes
ctx.graph.ancestors(cid)     # cells this one depends on
```

In marimo, deletes are *destructive* so it can be useful to query the
descendants prior to deleting to understand it's impact.

## Writing Notebook Changes

The graph contract keeps marimo able to run and save the notebook. Passing
those checks alone does not guarantee a useful artifact. Committed cells should
still be readable, rerunnable, and editable.

Make durable edits that reuse the notebook's existing names, imports,
dependencies, and UI model. Don't be lazy. Avoid one-off workarounds that pass
`cm` validation but leave a brittle notebook.

### Cell Bodies

Submit the code that belongs in the cell.

- **Submit cell contents** - `create_cell` and `edit_cell` take cell contents,
  not saved-file `@app.cell` wrappers.
- **Read before replacing** - for now, another editor may change a cell between
  scratchpad calls. Before `edit_cell`, read the current body from
  `ctx.cells[...]` and submit the full replacement.
- **Reuse notebook imports** - if `np` already exists, use it or edit the owning
  import cell. DO NOT add `import numpy as _np` just to bypass the graph.
- **Define public names intentionally** - use public names for values later
  cells should reference. Use private `_name` bindings or function locals for
  same-cell intermediates.
- **Define each public name once** - a public name has one owning cell.
  Reassigning it in another cell fails with `Multiply-defined names`; edit the
  owning cell or give the result a new name. See
  [gotchas.md](reference/gotchas.md).
- **Run cells deliberately** - `create_cell` and `edit_cell` change structure
  only. Queue `ctx.run_cell(...)` when the cell should execute.

### Prefer `cm`-Managed Changes

Use `cm` APIs when they exist. Avoid direct file edits, shell package commands,
and scratchpad-only state for changes that should persist.

- **Do not edit the `.py` artifact** - DO NOT use `Edit`, `Write`, or
  `NotebookEdit` on the notebook file during a live session. Use
  `ctx.edit_cell(...)` even for small changes.
- **Manage packages through `cm`** - use `ctx.packages.add()` or
  `ctx.packages.remove()` instead of direct `uv` or `pip`; confirm
  non-obvious dependency changes.
- **Avoid transient paths** - persisted cells should not depend on `/tmp/...`
  unless the work is intentionally transient.
- **Delete deliberately** - deleting a cell removes globals it defines. Reuse
  empty cells when convenient and delete cells left empty after edits.

### UI and Widgets

Inspect the object before changing it. Different UI objects update through
different paths.

- **Set `mo.ui.*` through `cm`** - use `ctx.set_ui_value(element, value)` inside
  `cm.get_context()`.
- **Set anywidget traitlets directly** - synced traitlets are Python
  attributes, for example `widget.value = 5`.

[rich-representations.md](reference/rich-representations.md).

## DataCards Decks, Cards and Screenshots

In DataCards a notebook's cells appear as *cards*: on the Exposé view of the
notebook and on *decks* (fixed grids of `columns` x `rows` units on the
canvas). `cm` exposes the same actions a human has in the frontend. The deck,
template and screenshot methods are `async`, apply immediately on the
DataCards server, and work inside or outside `cm.get_context()` (they are not
queued like cell edits):

```python
import marimo._code_mode as cm

ctx = cm.get_context()
async with ctx:
    # Card title and footprint (grid units, 1..24 x 1..12); the size is
    # the card's size in Exposé and its default size on a deck.
    ctx.edit_cell("chart", title="Revenue", size=(4, 2))

decks = await ctx.list_decks()  # Deck(id, columns, rows, cards, ...)
deck = await ctx.get_deck("overview")

# Place a cell of this notebook; position=None takes the first free spot.
card = await ctx.add_card_to_deck("overview", "chart", position=(0, 0))
await ctx.edit_card_on_deck("overview", card, position=(4, 0), size=(2, 2))
await ctx.remove_card_from_deck("overview", card)

# Card-store templates: place one, then assign it to a notebook, which
# inserts and runs the template's cells there (like the "assign" button).
templates = await ctx.list_templates()  # TemplateInfo(id, title, size)
tpl = await ctx.add_template_to_deck("overview", "integer-slider")
result = await ctx.assign_template_to_notebook("overview", tpl, "nb.py")
# or: await ctx.assign_template_to_notebook("overview", tpl, new_notebook="controls")

# Screenshots (headless Chromium; needs `playwright` + chromium):
png = await ctx.screenshot("chart")  # one cell's output
png = await ctx.screenshot_deck("overview")  # the deck on its own page
png = await ctx.screenshot_graph()  # the process graph on the canvas
await ctx.close_screenshot_session()  # when used outside `async with`
```

- **Cards reference cells by notebook path** - a cell card id is
  `"<notebook path>.py-<cell id>"`, where the path is relative to the
  workspace root (`"nb.py-Hbol"` for a root notebook, `"sub/nb.py-Hbol"` for
  one in a folder); pass the cell (id, name, index) and `cm` derives the id
  from the current notebook. Pass the same relative path as `notebook_file`
  to `assign_template_to_notebook`. Template cards are `"template:<uuid>"`.
- **Decks are bounded** - a card must fit in `columns` x `rows` and an
  explicit `position=` must not overlap another card; `cm` raises
  `ValueError` (naming the blocking card) when it does not fit and
  `DeckError` when the deck has no free spot left. `add_card_to_deck`
  refuses a cell that is already on the deck; use `edit_card_on_deck` to move
  or resize it.
- **Run before you place** - a deck card shows the cell's output; an unrun
  cell shows nothing. `screenshot_deck` reloads the deck page, waits for
  every card's cell state (a few seconds at most) and captures the deck as it
  is, so a card of a notebook that is not running comes out empty.
- **Check the result** - use `screenshot_deck` / `screenshot_graph` to verify
  a layout the way the user will see it. Screenshots return PNG bytes;
  `as_data_url=True` returns a data URL and `save_to=` also writes the file,
  on the machine running the kernel (in the cloud, inside the project
  sandbox). The DataCards cloud images ship `playwright` and Chromium; a
  local kernel needs `ctx.packages.add("playwright")` and
  `python -m playwright install chromium`.
- **Errors** - `DeckError` for an unknown deck, card or template, a server
  error (the message carries the server's text) or a call outside code mode;
  `ValueError` for a bad position or size; `ScreenshotError` for a missing
  browser or a page that did not render. Use `help(ctx.add_card_to_deck)`
  and friends for the full argument lists.
